      'A black hole 🕳️ is an astronomical object with an extremely strong gravitational pull, so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Formed from the remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity, black holes come in various sizes—from stellar black holes formed by dying stars to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies. The boundary surrounding a black hole, beyond which nothing can return, is called the event horizon. Black holes are fascinating because they challenge our understanding of physics and reveal the complex nature of gravity and spacetime. 🌌🔭',
